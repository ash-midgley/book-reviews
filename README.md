# Bookshelf
Mid last year I found myself between jobs and reading more than usual. I was after a cool way to keep an eye on the stuff I was reading but none of the available options really struck my fancy. [This](https://bookshelf.co.nz) is my crack at something a bit smaller and simpler. You can share your shelf with others, customize the categories and ratings that you add books to and manage your account. All the book data is pulled from the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books).

The frontend is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and the backend is a [.NET Core Web API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/?view=aspnetcore-3.1). Putting this together has answered a bunch of questions that I had about building web apps:
