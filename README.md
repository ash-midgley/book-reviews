# Bookshelf
Mid last year I found myself between jobs and reading more than usual. I was after a cool way to keep an eye on the stuff I was reading but none [of](https://www.litsy.com/web/home) [the](https://www.librarything.com/) [available](https://www.libib.com/) [options](https://www.goodreads.com/) really struck my fancy. [This](https://bookshelf.co.nz) is my crack at something smaller and simpler, but more in line with what I was after. You can share your shelf with others, customize the categories and ratings that you add books to and manage your account. All the book data is pulled from the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books).

The frontend is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and the backend is a [.NET Core Web API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/?view=aspnetcore-3.1). Putting this together has answered a bunch of questions that I had about building web apps:
 - [How do you implement JWT Authentication in .NET Core?]()
 - [How do you securely store passwords in a database?]()
 - [What happens when a user forgets their password?]()
 - [How do you send emails in .NET Core?](https://dotnetcoretutorials.com/2017/11/02/using-mailkit-send-receive-email-asp-net-core/)
 - [What are security headers and how do I use them in .NET Core?](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/EasilyAddingSecurityHeadersToYourASPNETCoreWebAppAndGettingAnAGrade.aspx)
 - [How do you connect the web API container to the MSSQL container?]()
 - [How do you backup a database in a MSSQL docker container?]()
 - [How do you install Nginx on a Linux server?](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04)
 - [How do you setup SSL certs for Nginx?](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04)

 Thank goodness for smart people writing articles about stuff on the internet.
